# Jimdo 
[Jimdo](https://www.jimdo.com/) is a user-friendly website builder that allows anyone to create websites without coding. It offers customizable templates, drag-and-drop design, and tools for e-commerce and SEO. Ideal for small businesses and individuals, Jimdo simplifies creating a professional online presence. 
Using Jimdo can save a lot of time compared to building a website from scratch. 

However, there are some limitations to editing. With the "Creator" plan, Jimdo allows users to modify the Head HTML. 
In HTML, if you use the script tag, it allows you to write JavaScript code. I managed the code and created a translation function in the navbar.
